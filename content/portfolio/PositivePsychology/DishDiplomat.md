This project aims at building a website that helps the international students at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. The website serves as an English canteen menu and helps the students to order foods in the university canteens. To make sure the website is appropriate under all situations, we followed the Google Material Design. 

The website is built with Vuetify on top of Vue.js and hosted on Cloudflare Pages. 

The website is currently running at https://sjtucanteen.com/ .
