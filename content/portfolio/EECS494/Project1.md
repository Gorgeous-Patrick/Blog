This is a remake of the first version of **Legend of Zelda** released by Nintendo in 1986 on NES. This remake includes a revision of the original Dungeon level and most of the core mechanics shipped with the game. 

We also added a few new features to the game. I want to keep it a secret here. You can play and explore it all by yourself. 

Press X to use your sword and Z to use your alternative weapon (exactly what it was in the original NES game).
