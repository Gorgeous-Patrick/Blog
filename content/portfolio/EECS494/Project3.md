## What is Cavelit

Cavelit is a game where the player is put into a mineshaft. They need to walk around and avoid all kinds of dangers. The player should think hard to get to the destination without being killed by falling rocks. 

<center><h2>The game is still under active development. We will soon release it.</h2></center>
