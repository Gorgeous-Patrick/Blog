## Who am I

Hi! I am Baichuan Li. You can call me Patrick (if you find my name hard to pronounce). I am a senior undergraduate student from the University of Michigan, majoring in Computer Science. 

## My Education Experiences

I am an undergraduate student currently attending a dual degree program between the University of Michigan and Shanghai Jiaotong University. So I studied in China from 2019 to 2021 and I have been at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor since June 2021.

## My Interests

I love working on web. I am familiar with most aspects of it, including back-end engineering and computer security. I have developed several projects in school. You can check the portfolio tab and see all of them.
