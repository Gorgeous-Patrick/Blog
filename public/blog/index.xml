      <description>This is the first time I have ever paid a visit to a formal academic conference
My Badge of KubeCon
Conference about In-Time data analysis
A nice fuzz generator that can generate random test cases to make your program robust
A high schooler sharing his ideas about open-source development
Gavin said that it reminded him of his high school age.
An online encyclopedia for Cloud Native terminology
I think I will try it.</description>

      <description>Threat Model Alice computes v=f(m), where v is a verifier of the message m. Alice sends the message to Bob via Mallory. Bob verifies that v&#39;=f(m&#39;). Random Function (RF) Set up a random map f: {Fixed size input}-&amp;gt;{Fixed size output}. This function is only known by Alice and Bob, but unknown to Mallory.
Provably secure: Mallory cannot find out the verifier of a message that he has never seen (he cannot do it better than guessing).</description>
