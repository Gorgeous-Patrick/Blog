      <description>This is a remake of the first version of Legend of Zelda released by Nintendo in 1986 on NES. This remake includes a revision of the original Dungeon level and most of the core mechanics shipped with the game.
We also added a few new features to the game. I want to keep it a secret here. You can play and explore it all by yourself.
Press X to use your sword and Z to use your alternative weapon (exactly what it was in the original NES game).</description>
