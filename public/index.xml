      <description>Project Description The project was created at the request of Professor Manuel Charlemagne of Shanghai Jiaotong University. We expect the website to demonstrate the masterpieces created by our students in a web game development course. The website is designed to automatically fetch, deploy and demonstrate the student projects.
The website is currently hosted at: https://focs.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/silverfocs/. The accessibility from the US depends on the network status of Shanghai Jiaotong University.
Skills Used In this project, we used ELM, a new front-end language, to build the appearance of the entire website.</description>

      <description>This is a remake of the first version of Legend of Zelda released by Nintendo in 1986 on NES. This remake includes a revision of the original Dungeon level and most of the core mechanics shipped with the game.
We also added a few new features to the game. I want to keep it a secret here. You can play and explore it all by yourself.
Press X to use your sword and Z to use your alternative weapon (exactly what it was in the original NES game).</description>

      <description>The Jaseci Mission The mission of Jaseci is to accelerate and democratize the development and deployments of end-to-end scalable AI applications. To this end, Jaseci presents a novel set of higher level abstractions for programming sophisticated software in a micro-service/serverless AI and a full stack architecture and programming model that abstracts away and automates much of the complexity of building applications on a distributed compute substrate of potentially thousands of compute nodes.</description>
